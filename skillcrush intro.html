  Human beings are more alike than unalike, and what is true anywhere is true
  everywhere, yet I encourage travel to as many destinations as possible for the
  sake of education as well as pleasure...by demonstrating that all people cry,
  laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try to
  understand each other, we may even become friends.

<h2>Remote</h2>

  Remote work often means a company may or may not have a physical office, and
  you can work for the company from <em>virtually anywhere.</em>
</p>

<h2><strong>On-site</strong></h2>

<h3>Choosing a locations</h3>
<p>When looking for jobs in design and development, consider each work location and how it <strong>matches your needs.</strong></p>
